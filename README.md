project51
=========

Project51 is a 8051 simulator. 

I created this for academic purposes about four years ago. I was just learning and wanted to experiment with stuff.
As you can expect its not perfect but I think someone will find it helpfull.

The project has 3 parts
	1. A compiler (C++)
	2. An executer (C++)
	3. An editor (VB.NET)
	
The compiler will read the source fiile and convert it into an object file.

The ececuter can execute this file. unfortunately it does not produce any output files.
You will only be able to see the final result.

The editor is GUI for the simulator. 
It has a text editor and it will show the status of registers and memory locations.
It basically runs the compiler an executer in the background.
